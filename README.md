# project-euler
My solutions to some of the problems found on Project Euler.
I primarily worked in java though for some I worked in python.

The way I approached these problems were:
    1. If the problem seemed trivial I brute forced it.
    2. For more difficult / time consuming problems I
       approached in a more efficient manner.
    3. Some I tried a more creative approach even if it
       was not the most efficient.

Comments:
    1. Some code is copied and pasted between problems
       because I wanted all answers to be stand alone
    2. Some methods that should be private are not because
       I like to live on the edge
